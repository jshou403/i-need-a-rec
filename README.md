## How The App Works

"I Need A Rec" provides recommendations for the location of the user's choice and search categories! Using Yelp, the user can search up to three categories of their choice and view the top 5 results for each category. If the user wants to see a recommendation on the map, they have the option to "map it." The user also has the option to pin their hotel or location of choice to the same map by adding in their address to view proximity and plan accordingly. 

## Future Developments
* Allow user to save pinned locations to an itinerary.
